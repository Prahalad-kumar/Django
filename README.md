# Django Project

🌟 About this repository  
A tidy collection of small, self-contained Django example projects and exercises. Each project lives in its own folder with a dedicated README explaining setup and purpose. This repo is a convenient hub to browse, run, and learn from multiple minimal Django demos.

✨ Quick idea
- Purpose: showcase simple Django patterns and small apps (auth, CRUD, APIs, templates).
- Who it's for: learners, hobbyists, and anyone wanting ready-to-run examples.
- How to use: open a project folder, follow that project's README to install and run.

🗂️ Structure (simple)
- /project-1/ — small app with README
- /project-2/ — another example with README
- /common/ — shared utils or notes (optional)
